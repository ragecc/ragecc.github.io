I'm a devoloper and designer. I've always been interested in figuring out what makes things work, and how they do what they do. I've been pretty heavily involved with computers since around 1994. Windows 3.1 was the latest operating system thenat the time. I also run a lot of self hosted projects, 3d print, and mess with Arduino, and esp32.

I'm workig on figuring out what my next big project is going to be. Join me as I take that journey.
